# Unified-Quantum-Gravity
first princibles derived theory of quantum gravity via information density fields
I have developed and documented my Unified Quantum Gravity Model (UQGM) as of early February 2025 It incorporates entropy-based modifications to gravity via an information density field. Given the timing of recent publications touching on entrop and quantum gravity, I am making my work public to ensure transparency and establish priority.
